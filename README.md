# My Home Binaries #

just a silly collection of binaries, I like to share among different machines. All of these binaries reside in my $HOME/bin directory which is part of my search path.

These binaries include:

 * `make_pod.sh` creates .pdf Files from a series of .pm/.pod files
 * `update_minicpan.sh` updates my minicpan mirror


more things will get added from time to time.
